# Wake-County-Data-R
This code creates a visual of precinct results using data from the past two mayoral races in Raleigh, NC. In the 2017 race, the contenders were Nancy McFarlane and Charles Francis with McFarlane winning after a run-off election. In the 2019 race, Mary-Ann Baldwin beat Charles Francis after another close race. 

Racial and gender analysis was performed using publicly available voting records to show a clear difference in the demographics of the precincts won by the mayoral contenders.

Data from http://www.wakegov.com/elections/data/Pages/data.aspx

The shape files were downloaded from the Wake County site at:

This map shows the vote differential by precinct in the 2019 race with darker green representing more votes for Baldwin and darker red (negative values) for Francis.
Since it was a mayoral race, not all Wake County precincts were included so gray areas show precincts in Wake County but not in Raleigh proper. The first shows the margin from vote count and the second shows the percent difference.
