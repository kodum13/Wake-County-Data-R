# Wake-County-Data-R
The original data is from the 2 most recent mayoral races in Raleigh, NC. In the 2017 race, the top vote getters were Nancy McFarlane and Charles Francis with McFarlane winning after a run-off election. In the 2019 race, Mary-Ann Baldwin beat Charles Francis after another close race. 

Data from http://www.wakegov.com/elections/data/Pages/data.aspx

The shape files were downloaded from the Wake County site at:

This map shows the vote differential by precinct with darker green representing more votes for Baldwin and darker red (negative values) for Francis.
Since it was a mayoral race, not all of Wake County was included so gray areas show precincts in Wake County but not in Raleigh proper.
